# 🧠 Data Science Learning Journey

Hi! I'm **Hadia Arshad**, and this repository is where I document my journey of learning **Python** and **Data Science** — from beginner basics to real-world projects.

This repo contains:
- ✨ Practice exercises using Python and core programming concepts
- 📊 Data science mini projects using dictionaries, logic, and lists
- 📈 NumPy-based notebooks for performance, slicing, and array manipulation
- 🧪 Comparisons of Python lists vs NumPy arrays (speed, memory, optimization)
